# gym-gazebo Hide and Seek
## FA20 Computational Robotics Final Project
*Siddharth Garimella and Anusha Datar*

## Overview
This website contains a description of our system's overall functionality and architecture on our [System Overview](https://anushadatar.github.io/gym-gazebo-hide-and-seek/System-Overview.html) page, a guide to setting up gym on ROS Kinetic (which we spent a large portion of our time working on this project developing) on the [Getting Started](https://anushadatar.github.io/gym-gazebo-hide-and-seek/Getting-Started.html) page, and some stories about our work on the [Blog Posts](https://anushadatar.github.io/gym-gazebo-hide-and-seek/Blog-Posts.html) page.

## Demonstration
In this project, we recreate the OpenAI Hide and Seek demonstration using ROS and Gazebo. We spent a large portion of the project creating an envrionment and procedure by which to use the gym library with gazebo and ROS. Following this work, we developed a way to place two turtlebots in the simulation, and then we trained one turtlebot to be the seeker and one turtlebot to be the hider. While difficult to see initially, this results in simulations where the seeker gradually improves at finding the hidden turtlebot!
